**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.  

**KANISHKA:** Kanishka, Admin Staff. I handle scheduling and finance support.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe your activities on the evening of August 29th?  

**KANISHKA:** Tejas and I went to the CFO's office around 10 PM to get some sweets he had kept there.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** And what happened inside the office?  

**KANISHKA:** We had the sweets, nothing unusual. After that, I picked up the empty box—it seemed better to throw it away rather than leave a mess in his cabin.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Witnesses say you left the office carrying that box quite carefully. Why?  

**KANISHKA:** *[agitated]* Careful? No, I was just holding it normally. People are reading too much into it—it was just an empty box!  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You’re sure you didn’t see or take anything else from the CFO’s office?  

**KANISHKA:** Yes. I took the box out to dispose of it, that’s it.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you notice anything unusual that night?  

**KANISHKA:** No, I left soon after. Everything seemed normal to me.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Is there anything else you'd like to add?  

**KANISHKA:** I think people are making this bigger than it is. I just didn’t want to leave trash behind.
