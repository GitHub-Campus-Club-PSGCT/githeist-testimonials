**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**KANISHKA:** Kanishka , Admin Staff. I manage scheduling, fund records, and provide finance support.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**KANISHKA:** Tejas and I went to the CFO's office around 10:07 PM for some sweets he had mentioned.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What happened in the office?

**KANISHKA:** We got the sweets. I noticed something on his desk that seemed... important. Something he shouldn't have left lying around.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What did you do?

**KANISHKA:** I picked it up. Put it in a box I found there to keep it safe.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** People saw you leaving with that box. You seemed very careful with it.

**KANISHKA:** *[defensive]* I was being careful because it was important. I didn't want it to get lost or damaged.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Why didn't you leave it in the office?

**KANISHKA:** *[hesitant]* I thought... I thought it would be safer with me overnight. I was going to return it in the morning.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you use whatever was in that box?

**KANISHKA:** No! I kept it locked in my desk. I never touched it after I put it there.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you notice anything else unusual that night?

**KANISHKA:** I went home shortly after. Didn't know there were any problems until the next morning.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Is there anything else you'd like to add?

**KANISHKA:** I was just trying to keep something safe. I didn't know it would cause problems.
