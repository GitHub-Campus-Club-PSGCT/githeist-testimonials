**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**JAYASURYA:** Jayasurya , Software Developer. I build and manage internal finance tools.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you account for your whereabouts on the evening of August 29th?

**JAYASURYA:** I was working late on code. 

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You gave Richitha a USB drive. Tell us about that.

**JAYASURYA:** *[pauses]* She wanted some files to... brighten up someone's computer. So I gave her mine.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What kind of stuff where already in it?

**JAYASURYA:** It was just images and some memes she had asked for.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You were seen near Abbilaash's desk around 11:05 PM.

**JAYASURYA:** *[nervous]* We collaborate sometimes. I was just... checking on something.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Files were deleted from his system right after you were there.

**JAYASURYA:** *[agitated]* That's coincidence! Maybe the system was cleaning itself up or something.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** The USB you gave Richitha had more than just images on it.

**JAYASURYA:** *[long pause]* I don't know how that's possible. Maybe someone tampered with it after I gave it to her.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else you want to tell us?

**JAYASURYA:** I just gave her a USB. That's all. If something bad was on it, I didn't know about it.
