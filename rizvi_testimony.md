**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**RIZVI:** Rizvi , Finance Communications. I manage executive correspondence and financial reporting.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you account for your whereabouts on the evening of August 29th?

**RIZVI:** I was working late on reports. Stayed until around 12:30 AM finishing up.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You sent Vishal a message at 12:20 AM saying "Transfer successful." Explain.  

**RIZVI:** *[confident]* That wasnâ€™t about reports. Vishal asked me to send some money for a personal deed, so I did it.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** A personal deed?  

**RIZVI:** *[defensive]* Yes. He said it was something private, not official work. I only transferred it because he asked me directly.  

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** The timing coincides with other events that night.

**RIZVI:** *[uncomfortable]* I was just doing my job as a friend. If other things were happening, I didn't know about them.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You work with Darshan on projects?

**RIZVI:** *[pause]* Sometimes. He handles servers, I need system access for reports.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else about that night?

**RIZVI:** I was managing communications and reports. That's all. If something else was happening, I wasn't part of it.
