**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**RICHITHA:** Richitha , IT Support. I handle system access and support for the finance staff.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you walk me through your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**RICHITHA:** I was working late that night. Around 10:40 PM, I went to the CFO's office to... well, I had a USB drive with some files I wanted to put on his computer. Just some harmless stuff to brighten up his day.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you be more specific about what was on the USB?

**RICHITHA:** *[hesitant]* I thought it was just some funny images. Someone had given it to me earlier.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Who gave you the USB?

**RICHITHA:** *[pause]* Jayasurya. 

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you check what was on the drive?

**RICHITHA:** *[quietly]* No... I trusted him. I just plugged it in and copied the files over.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** We found some messages between you and Dhaarun that night.

**RICHITHA:** *[shifts uncomfortably]* Yes, I sent him a message around 12 AM. I was... proud of what I thought I'd done. But then he started asking questions about whose USB it was.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What happened after that?

**RICHITHA:** Things got confusing. Dhaarun seemed worried about something. 

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Is there anything else you remember from that night?

**RICHITHA:** Just that I should have been more careful. I should have checked what I was actually putting on that computer.
