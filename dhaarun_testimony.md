**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**DHAARUN:** Dhaarun , Research Associate. I work on financial data modeling and automation systems.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**DHAARUN:** I was working late on data analysis. Running some scripts around midnight.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Richitha sent you messages that night. What about?

**DHAARUN:** She sent something at 11:55 PM about "successfully inserting memes." I didn't know what she meant.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What did you ask her?

**DHAARUN:** I asked whose USB it was. Her message seemed... odd.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What did she say?

**DHAARUN:** She said it was Jayasurya's. That worried me.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Why?

**DHAARUN:** Jayasurya had been acting strange lately. Working odd hours, being secretive.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You sent a message saying "I'll go check once." Check what?

**DHAARUN:** I wanted to see if everything was okay with the system. If Jayasurya's USB had been used...

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You were seen near the treasury at 12:19 AM.

**DHAARUN:** *[surprised]* I was trying to find the CFO's office in the dark. Got turned around. The treasury is in that area.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you make it to the CFO's office?

**DHAARUN:** No. Got lost in the dark, then there was chaos. Alarms going off. I went back to my desk.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else you remember?

**DHAARUN:** Just that I should have checked on things sooner. When Richitha mentioned Jayasurya's USB... I had a bad feeling about it.
