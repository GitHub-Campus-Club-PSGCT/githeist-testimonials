**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**DHAARUN:** Dhaarun , Research Associate. I work on financial data modeling and automation systems.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**DHAARUN:** I was working late on data analysis. Running some scripts around midnight.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Richitha sent you messages that night. What about?

**DHAARUN:** She sent about "successfully inserted memes using the USB."

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What did you reply to her?

**DHAARUN:** I asked whose USB it was. Her message seemed... odd.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What did she say?

**DHAARUN:** She said it was Jayasurya's. That worried me.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Why?

**DHAARUN:** Jayasurya had been acting strange lately. Working odd hours, being secretive.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You sent a message saying "I'll go check once." Check what?

**DHAARUN:** I wanted to see if everything was okay with the system.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You were seen near the treasury at 12:19 AM.

**DHAARUN:** *[surprised]* I was going to the CFO's office. 

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you make it to the CFO's office?

**DHAARUN:** Yes.I checked if everything she did was working and then returned back.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else you remember?

**DHAARUN:**  Not really.
