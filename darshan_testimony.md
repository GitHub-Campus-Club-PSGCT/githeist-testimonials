**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**DARSHAN:** Darshan , Systems Administrator. I maintain servers and system logs for the company.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you account for your whereabouts on the evening of August 29th?

**DARSHAN:** I was doing server maintenance and log management. I work late to avoid disrupting day operations.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Logs were deleted at 12:20 AM. Explain.

**DARSHAN:** *[defensive]* I do regular log cleanup. It's part of maintenance. Old logs slow down the system.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** These were recent logs from that evening.

**DARSHAN:** *[nervous]* Sometimes the automated cleanup doesn't work right. I have to delete logs manually.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** We found evidence that funds were transferred to your account.

**DARSHAN:** *[shocked]* What? That's impossible! I don't have access to financial systems.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** The evidence is clear.

**DARSHAN:** *[agitated]* Someone set me up! I never authorized any transfers. I don't know how they got my account information.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You deleted the logs that would show who accessed systems that night.

**DARSHAN:** *[panicking]* I was just doing my job! I didn't know it would cover anything up.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Do you work with Rizvi?

**DARSHAN:** *[hesitant]* Sometimes. She needs server access for reports.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did she ask you to do anything unusual?

**DARSHAN:** *[pause]* She asked for some... access modifications a few weeks ago. Said it was for security.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What kind of modifications?

**DARSHAN:** *[quietly]* Some backdoor access. She said management authorized it.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you verify that?

**DARSHAN:** *[ashamed]* No... he said it was confidential.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else?

**DARSHAN:** I think... I think he used what I created to set me up. I never saw any money. I didn't know.
