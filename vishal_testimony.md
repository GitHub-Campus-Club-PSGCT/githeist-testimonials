**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**VISHAL:** Vishal , Security Analyst. I handle transaction security and access control for the company's financial systems.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**VISHAL:** I was monitoring security logs. Noticed some unusual patterns. Met with Shashwath around midnight to discuss it.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What time was this meeting?

**VISHAL:** 12:00 AM to 12:08 AM in the manager's office.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What did you discuss?

**VISHAL:** Irregular access patterns. Some login attempts that seemed... off. Transaction logs that didn't look normal.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** You made a commit at 12:13 AM. Why?

**VISHAL:** Implemented some security measures after our meeting.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Rizvi sent you a message at 12:20 AM saying "Transfer successful." Explain.

**VISHAL:** *[uncomfortable]* Rizvi was running some kind of... test. Said he was checking if our monitoring systems would catch unusual activity.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What kind of test?

**VISHAL:** *[defensive]* He said it was authorized. A security test to see if we'd detect irregular transfers.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you verify this authorization?

**VISHAL:** *[quietly]* Rizvi said it had to be confidential. That management wanted to test without alerting anyone.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else?

**VISHAL:** I thought I was helping with security. I didn't know... I didn't know it was real.
