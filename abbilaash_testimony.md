**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**ABBILAASH:** Abbilaash , Backend Engineer. I maintain databases and transaction logs for the company.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you walk me through your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**ABBILAASH:** I was working late on database tasks. Around 11 PM, I went to get coffee from the cafeteria.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** How long were you away?

**ABBILAASH:** Just a few minutes. When I came back, my computer seemed... different somehow.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Different how?

**ABBILAASH:** Some windows I had open were closed. The system felt slower. I thought maybe it had updated itself or something.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you see anyone near your workstation?

**ABBILAASH:** *[thinking]* Yes, actually. When I was coming back, I saw Jayasurya near my desk. 

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you talk to him?

**ABBILAASH:** No, he was already leaving. We work together sometimes, so I didn't think much of it.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** We found that files were deleted from your system that night. Did you delete anything?

**ABBILAASH:** *[surprised]* No, I didn't delete anything. What kind of files?

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** System logs. Access records. Could someone have used your computer while you were gone?

**ABBILAASH:** *[uncomfortable]* I... I sometimes leave it unlocked for short breaks. We trust each other here. Or at least, I thought we did.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else unusual that night?

**ABBILAASH:** People were working late. More than usual, maybe. But I was focused on my own work.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Alright.You can leave now.
