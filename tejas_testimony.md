**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Please state your name and position for the record.

**TEJAS:** Tejas, CFO's Assistant. I manage the CFO's schedule, office access, and documents.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe your activities on the evening of August 29th?

**TEJAS:** Kanishka and I went to the CFO's office around 10:07 PM. He had mentioned there were some sweets we could have.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What happened in the office?

**TEJAS:** We found the sweets. While we were there, I noticed a small box on the shelf with the CFO's initials. It seemed like something personal, so I took it to keep it safe.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Can you describe this box?

**TEJAS:** Small wooden box. It felt like there was something inside when I picked it up.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you look inside?

**TEJAS:** Not until the next morning when all this started. Just his watch. Nothing important.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you notice Kanishka doing anything unusual?

**TEJAS:** *[pauses]* Well, she picked up this box from the CFO's desk. Empty box, as far as I could tell.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** What was unusual about that?

**TEJAS:** The way she was carrying it. Like it was... precious or something. But it looked empty to me. I don't know why she was being so careful with an empty box.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Did you ask her about it?

**TEJAS:** No, I figured it wasn't my business. But it stuck with me, you know? The way she held that box like it contained something valuable when it clearly didn't.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Anything else you remember from that night?

**TEJAS:** Just that everyone seemed to be working late. More people than usual.

**DETECTIVE CHEN:** Is there anything else you'd like to add?

**TEJAS:** I went home shortly after. Didn't know anything was wrong until the next morning when everyone was talking about... problems.
